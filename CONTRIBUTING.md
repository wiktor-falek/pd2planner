- **Don't add unnecessary features**: Only add features that are listed in the roadmap, if you're unsure or have suggestions, open an Issue.
- **Stay on topic**: Don't make unrelated changes or introduce things that aren't relevant to the core functionality.
- **Test your changes**: Make sure your changes donâ€™t break anything and work as expected.
